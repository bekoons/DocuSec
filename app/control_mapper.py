    Security considerations
    -----------------------
    * Input data is trusted blindly.  In a real application, validate and
      sanitize ``chunks`` to avoid inadvertently exposing sensitive
      information.
    * There is no authentication or authorization.  Ensure only authorized
      users can trigger control mapping when dealing with proprietary data.
